This is the statically compiled sass compiler, found here:
https://github.com/hcatlin/sassc

It seems, the version of libsass included there is older than the original,
found here:
https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass

So, I copied the original libsass files over the bundled ones. 
ATN: I needed to restore the bundled Makefiles!
