Title: The Long Game
Slug: The-Long-Game

The Long Game
=============

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
\*Insistently\* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell
me what normal blokes do! Saving the world with meals on wheels. It's a
fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You know how I sometimes have
really brilliant ideas?

Gridlock
--------

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every
time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Annihilate? No. No
violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand
me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat
them in a football match, didn't you? It's art! A statement on modern
society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

### The Curse of the Black Spot

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I am
the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Sorry, checking all the water in
this area; there's an escaped fish. It's art! A statement on modern
society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

#### The Unicorn and the Wasp

You hit me with a cricket bat. You know how I sometimes have really
brilliant ideas? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known
him: Jeff.

1.  I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every
    time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
2.  No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
3.  I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I
    call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
4.  I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I
    call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
5.  I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart
    so don't lie to me!

##### Smith and Jones

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I am the last of my
species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You
hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Stop
talking, brain thinking. Hush. You know how I sometimes have really
brilliant ideas?

###### Bad Wolf

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not
gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a
spaceship. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him:
Jeff. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine'
and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I am the
last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie
to me!

Saving the world with meals on wheels. You've swallowed a planet! Stop
talking, brain thinking. Hush. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary
human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? No… It's a thing;
it's like a plan, but with more greatness. The way I see it, every life
is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't
always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't
necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm
the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. They're not aliens, they're
Earth…liens! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know
why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Sorry, checking
all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I'm the Doctor.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so
don't lie to me! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! It's art! A statement
on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I hate yogurt. It's
just stuff with bits in. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor.
