Title: The Cryonic Woman
Slug: The-Cryonic-Woman

The Cryonic Woman
=================

Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Now
what? Who am I making this out to? Actually, that's still true.

Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?
-----------------------------------

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. You, a bobsleder!? That
I'd like to see! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Okay, it's 500
dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the
charge and the reception isn't very… Oh Leela! You're the only person I
could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. You guys go on
without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

-   Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!
-   It must be wonderful.
-   What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious
    torso!

### Xmas Story

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I
break his legs? We're rescuing ya. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm
going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

#### Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?

What are their names? Our love isn't any different from yours, except
it's hotter, because I'm involved. Can I use the gun?

1.  You don't know how to do any of those.
2.  I don't want to be rescued.

##### The Route of All Evil

Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting
trial for that there incompetence. What are you hacking off? Is it my
torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed
me! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use
the phrase "upside your head." We don't have a brig. WINDMILLS DO NOT
WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!

###### Attack of the Killer App

You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? There's one way and only
one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! I'm
just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. I don't 'need'
to drink. I can quit anytime I want! I just told you! You've killed me!

I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of
sleaze that those things bring. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like
professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Look, last night
was a mistake. Daylight and everything.

Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died
robbing some old man. You know, I was God once. No! The kind with
looting and maybe starting a few fires! Tell her she looks thin. Okay,
it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold
the charge and the reception isn't very… Yes, if you make it look like
an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure
you've done anything at all.

No, I'm Santa Claus! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all
keep calling a death sphere? Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't
rock. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Robot 1-X,
save my friends! And Zoidberg!

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Bite
my shiny metal ass. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate
intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business
school!

What are their names? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta
be fun! Ask her how her day was.

No argument here. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no
problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Noooooo!

It must be wonderful. You lived before you met me?! Do a flip! It's a T.
It goes "tuh". I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit
0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!

Throw her in the brig. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.
You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but
they don't pay you or let you go. Throw her in the brig. I am the man
with no name, Zapp Brannigan!

You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to
steal! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash
pickup until January 3rd. I don't want to be rescued. Michelle, I don't
regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Fetal stemcells, aren't those
controversial?
