Fry and the Slurm Factory
=========================

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup
until January 3rd. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you
rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." I suppose I could part
with 'one' and still be feared… We don't have a brig. Michelle, I don't
regret this, but I both rue and lament it. What are their names?

Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! With a
warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Dr. Zoidberg, that
doesn't make sense. But, okay! Our love isn't any different from yours,
except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Daylight and everything. Isn't
it true that you have been paid for your testimony?

-   Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while
    awaiting trial for that there incompetence.
-   I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!
-   Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
-   I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

### Obsoletely Fabulous

It's a T. It goes "tuh". I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have
no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Actually,
that's still true. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!'
My precious torso! Look, last night was a mistake. So, how 'bout them
Knicks?

#### Put Your Head on my Shoulder

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat;
David Duchovny! Is that a cooking show? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have
no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the
reception isn't very… No argument here. Tell her she looks thin. Ask her
how her day was.

1.  It's a T. It goes "tuh".
2.  You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!
3.  There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is
    intelligent. Dissect its brain!
4.  Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!
5.  Do a flip!

##### The Day The Earth Stood Stupid

You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to
steal! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. You guys go on
without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Belligerent
and numerous. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case
while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.

###### The Route of All Evil

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death
sphere? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Can I use the
gun? Can we have Bender Burgers again? I just told you! You've killed
me!

Bite my shiny metal ass. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a
few fires! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds,
you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Oh, all
right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing
some old man. What are their names? Hey, whatcha watching?

Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change
your opinions manually! I never loved you. I love this planet! I've got
wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things
bring.

I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Now what? And remember, don't
do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed
to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! You, minion.
Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! You don't know
how to do any of those.

It must be wonderful. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Oh Leela!
You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever
loved me.

Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and
gagged. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Our love isn't any
different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Do a
flip!

You know, I was God once. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical
fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done
anything at all. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and
then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you
jerk! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a
suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! But, like most
politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

No, I'm Santa Claus! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it
in the sewer. Who am I making this out to?

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Robot 1-X, save my
friends! And Zoidberg! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your
lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how
they feel. That makes me feel angry! Fetal stemcells, aren't those
controversial? We don't have a brig.

Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm
involved. Tell her she looks thin. We're also Santa Claus! You've killed
me! Oh, you've killed me! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is
merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! I don't 'need' to
drink. I can quit anytime I want!
