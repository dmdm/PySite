What… is your quest?
====================

Be quiet! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride
to Camelot! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the
enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

We want a shrubbery!!

Now, look here, my good man. Why? Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Why
do you think that she is a witch? Where'd you get the coconuts? No, no,
no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.

-   Look, my liege!
-   We found them.
-   How do you know she is a witch?
-   We found them.

### What a strange person

Be quiet! I'm not a witch. Well, what do you want? Ah, now we see the
violence inherent in the system! Camelot!

#### Help, help, I'm being repressed!

On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. The nose?
Bloody Peasant!

1.  We want a shrubbery!!
2.  The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
    held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by
    divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is
    why I am your king.
3.  We want a shrubbery!!

##### Am I right?

Where'd you get the coconuts? Shut up! You can't expect to wield supreme
power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! We shall say
'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.

###### What a strange person

Where'd you get the coconuts? The nose? You don't frighten us, English
pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my
nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English
K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! He hasn't got shit all over him. Why?

And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, what do you want?
Now, look here, my good man. Well, I got better. He hasn't got shit all
over him.

Burn her anyway! We want a shrubbery!! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a
sacrifice! Where'd you get the coconuts? A newt? Where'd you get the
coconuts?

A newt? We found them. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! We
want a shrubbery!! Well, I didn't vote for you. But you are dressed as
one…

How do you know she is a witch? Well, I didn't vote for you. You don't
vote for kings. Who's that then? A newt?

The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the
plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to
our land. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin

you mean? What do you mean? How do you know she is a witch?
