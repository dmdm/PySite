Title: Revenge of the Sith
Slug: Revenge-of-the-Sith

Revenge of the Sith
===================

I call it luck. You don't believe in the Force, do you? No! Alderaan is
peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…

Knights of the Old Republic
---------------------------

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self
and act on instinct. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?
You mean it controls your actions?

-   Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for
    you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
-   I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious
    self and act on instinct.
-   I call it luck.

### The Phantom Menace

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. What?! Escape is not his
plan. I must face him, alone. All right. Well, take care of yourself,
Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?

#### The Battle for Endor

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. You mean it controls your actions?
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

1.  Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
2.  What!?
3.  I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility
    yourself.

##### The Empire Strikes Back

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. In my
experience, there is no such thing as luck. I suggest you try it again,
Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I want to come
with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn
the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Hey,
Luke! May the Force be with you.

###### Attack of the Clones

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you,
Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. As you
wish. As you wish. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I need your help,
Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
As you wish.

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you,
Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Hey, Luke!
May the Force be with you. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing
and go home!

I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? The more you tighten your
grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I
call it luck. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

What?! I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the
Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- You're all clear,
kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! What?!

I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm
in for it as it is. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go
your conscious self and act on instinct.

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The
ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the
Force. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Look, I ain't in
this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect
to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Escape is not his plan. I must
face him, alone. Don't underestimate the Force. You are a part of the
Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Kid, I've
flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of
strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's
one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical
energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks
and nonsense. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your
conscious self and act on instinct. Partially, but it also obeys your
commands. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I
like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right
now. It's such a long way from here. Partially, but it also obeys your
commands.

You don't believe in the Force, do you? You don't believe in the Force,
do you? As you wish. You mean it controls your actions? I'm trying not
to, kid. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.
